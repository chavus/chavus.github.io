# `chavus` development notes

Welcome! I use this space to document and share notes about my findings, gotchas, tips, and tricks when doing development. I'm taking this as my personal knowledge base, which I hope also helps other developers to find some answers, solutions, or new approaches.

I'm currently working as Software Test Engineer, focusing mainly on building test automation frameworks with several technologies for different industries. But I also do some web development freelancing. The technologies I commonly work with are:
- `Javascript` for web development: `MERN`
- `Javascript` for test automation: `webdriver.io`
- `Java` for test automation: `Selenium`, `Cucumber`, `JUnit`, `Maven`
- `python` for web development: `flask`
- `python` for test automation: `Selenium`, `pytest`, `unittest`

Most of the content is related to languages and tools above.
